Hi Humans!

The name Vanillatail was inspired by the nickname of my friends - Tomatohead. It may sound not as crispy as hers, but still fits quite well for a Buffalo bunny!

Very experimental experiences here in Github. I hope I can strive on my steep learning curve in the coming few weeks.

Woohoo!
